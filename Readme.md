Face Detection AI using Python
Overview
This project implements a face detection system using OpenCV in Python. The system detects faces in images and can be trained to recognize specific individuals using the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and can be used to identify faces in new images.

Features
Face Detection: Uses Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in images.
